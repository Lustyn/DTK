# DTK - DTK Takes Keys
DTK is an application that downloads games from Nintendo's CDN using [FunKeyCIA](http://gbatemp.net/threads/release-funkeycia-make-good-cias-from-eshop-content-no-tickets-needed.423025/).

Currently it only shows basic data needed from your encTitleKeys file but you can already download using it.

## Warning
We aren't responsible if you use this for piracy. Use your own keys with this application.

## Requirements
* **python** - Required for running FunKeyCIA
* **encTitleKeys** - From your console
* **.NET Framework 4.5.2** - You should have this already
* **Working Internet Connection** - *duh*
