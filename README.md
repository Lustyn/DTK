# PSA: DTK is no longer in development and I would recommend using CDN-FX or Shameless instead.

## DTK - DTK Takes Keys
DTK is an application that downloads games from Nintendo's CDN using [FunKeyCIA](http://gbatemp.net/threads/release-funkeycia-make-good-cias-from-eshop-content-no-tickets-needed.423025/).

Currently it only shows basic data needed from your encTitleKeys file but you can already download using it.

## Warning
We aren't responsible if you use this for piracy. Use your own keys with this application.
